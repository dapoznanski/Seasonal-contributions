# metarepo
## [Check out the website for instructions](https://immm-sfa.github.io/metarepo)
`metarepo` is short for meta-repository, a GitHub repository that contains instructions to reproduce results in a published work. This repo is a template for creating your own metarepo.

## Purpose
A meta-repository creates a single point of access for someone to find all of the components that were used to create a published work for the purpose of reproducibility. This repository should contain references to all minted data and software as well as any ancillary code used to transform the source data, create figures for your publication, conduct the experiment, and / or execute the contributing software.

## Abstract
Densely populated coastal areas face increasing flood risk as rising sea levels combine with storm surges and high tides. Parts of the U.S. East Coast experience extratropical cyclones (ETCs) more frequently than tropical cyclones (TCs), yet many studies on extreme flood risk focus primarily on TCs or exclude ETCs altogether. ETCs occur primarily during November to April (henceforth, the cool season), while TCs occur primarily during May to October (hence-forth, the warm season). This study performs a quasi-nonstationary skew surge joint probability analysis of storm tide exceedance distributions for cool and warm season from 23 tide gauges along the U.S. east coast to assess seasonal contributions to extreme water levels. From Boston northward, cool-season extreme storm tides predominate, while south of Wilmington, warm-season storm tides predominate. In the mid-Atlantic, both seasons contribute substantially, with cool-season storms producing most short return-period events and warm-season storms producing most high-impact, long-return-period events. At The Battery location, cool season and warm season events contribute about equally to the average annual loss (AAL), but cool season events are responsible for the most common extreme floods, which are still very costly, while warm season events are responsible for the most extreme floods. These findings highlight the importance of treating cool and warm season storms as statistically separate to improve flood risk analysis and coastal protection.

## Journal reference
_your journal reference_

## Code reference
References for each minted software release for all code involved.  

These are generated by Zenodo automatically when conducting a release when Zenodo has been linked to your GitHub repository. The Zenodo references are built by setting the author order in order of contribution to the code using the author's GitHub username.  This citation can, and likely should, be edited without altering the DOI.

If you have modified a codebase that is outside of a formal release, and the modifications are not planned on being merged back into a version, fork the parent repository and add a `.<shortname>` to the version number of the parent and construct your own name.  For example, `v1.2.5.hydro`.

## Contributing modeling software
| Model | Repository Link | DOI |
|-------|-----------------|-----|
| qn-SSJPM | (https://zenodo.org/records/3898657) | link to DOI dataset |
| damage curve | https://github.com/dmr2/damage_allowance/blob/master/README.md | link to DOI dataset |

## Reproduce my experiment
The following script and data are in MATLAB language. A sample qn-SSJPM dataset from The Battery tide gauge is provided. For other locations, perform qn-SSJPM from Baranes et al. (2020) analysis prior to running the contribution script. The damage curve for Manhattan uses the data from Rasmussen et al. (2020), which is copied here. 

1. Install the software components required to conduct the experiment from [contributing modeling software](#contributing-modeling-software)
2. Download and install the supporting [input data](#input-data) required to conduct the experiment
3. Run the following scripts in the `workflow` directory to re-create this experiment:

| Script Name | Description | How to Run |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `seasonal_contribution.m` | Script to create plots. | `python3 step_one.py -f /path/to/inputdata/file_one.csv` |
| `step_two.py` | Script to run the second part of my experiment | `python3 step_two.py -o /path/to/my/outputdir` |

4. Download and unzip the [output data](#output-data) from my experiment 
5. Run the following scripts in the `workflow` directory to compare my outputs to those from the publication

| Script Name | Description | How to Run |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `compare.py` | Script to compare my outputs to the original | `python3 compare.py --orig /path/to/original/data.csv --new /path/to/new/data.csv` |

## Reproduce my figures
Use the scripts found in the `figures` directory to reproduce the figures used in this publication.

| Figure Number(s) | Script Name | Description | How to Run |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1, 2 | `generate_plot.py` | Description of figure, ie. "Plots the difference between our two scenarios" | `python3 generate_plot.py -input /path/to/inputs -output /path/to/outuptdir` |
| 3 | `generate_figure.py` | Description of figure, ie. "Shows how the mean and peak differences are calculated" | `python3 generate_figure.py -input /path/to/inputs -output /path/to/outuptdir` |
